<!-- ## About me -->

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ust.hk) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk), supervised by Prof. [Wei Wang](http://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). I obtained my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/main.htm) in 2022.

My research interests include distributed machine learning systems (**MLSys**) and **AI cloud infrastructure**. My current research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning** and scalable cloud infrastructure for **LLM Post-Training**.
